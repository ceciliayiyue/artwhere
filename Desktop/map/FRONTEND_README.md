## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash

```

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Leaflet.js** - Interactive maps
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **React Confetti** - Celebration effects

## üéÆ How to Play

1. A painting is displayed on the left/top
2. Click the map to place the **BLUE pin** where you think the painting was created
3. Click the map again to place the **RED pin** where you think the painting is now
4. Click "Submit Guess" to see results
5. If wrong, read the story about what happened to the painting
6. Click "Next Painting" to continue

## üéØ Game Mechanics

- **Scoring**: 1 point for each correct location (max 2 per round)
- **Accuracy**: Guesses within 100km are considered correct
- **Feedback**:
  - Green overlay + confetti = both correct
  - Yellow overlay = one correct
  - Red overlay = both wrong
- **Distance**: Shows how far off your guess was in kilometers
- **Story**: Appears when you miss, explaining the painting's journey

## üîå API Integration (Ready for Backend)

The app is designed to easily integrate with a backend API. Currently uses mock data in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
// Replace this mock data with API calls
const mockPaintings: Painting[] = [...]

// In GameContent component, replace:
const loadPainting = async () => {
  setGameState('loading');
  // Replace with: const data = await fetch('/api/paintings')
  const paintingIndex = (round - 1) % mockPaintings.length;
  setPainting(mockPaintings[paintingIndex]);
  setGameState('playing');
};
```

### Expected API Response Format

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  createdLocation: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    name?: string;
  };
  currentLocation: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    name?: string;
  };
  story?: string;
  storyImageUrl?: string;
}
```

## üé® Customization

### Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#4F46E5',    // Main brand color
      secondary: '#10B981',   // Success/positive
      accent: '#F59E0B',      // Highlights
    }
  }
}
```

### Accuracy Threshold
Edit `src/utils/distance.ts`:

```typescript
export function isGuessCorrect(
  guess: Location,
  actual: Location,
  threshold = 100  // Change this value (km)
): boolean
```

### Map Tiles
Edit `src/components/GameMap.tsx`:

```typescript
L.tileLayer('YOUR_TILE_URL/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: 'YOUR_ATTRIBUTION',
}).addTo(map);
```

## üì± Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Side-by-side layout (painting left, map right)
- **Tablet/Mobile**: Stacked layout (painting top, map bottom)
- **Breakpoint**: `lg` (1024px)

## ‚úÖ Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- WCAG AA color contrast ratios
- Screen reader friendly

## üêõ Known Issues / Future Enhancements

- [ ] Mobile touch support could be improved
- [ ] Add sound effects for feedback
- [ ] Add difficulty levels (different accuracy thresholds)
- [ ] Add leaderboard
- [ ] Add timer/speed bonus
- [ ] Add hints system
- [ ] Add painting categories/filters
- [ ] Add multiplayer support

## ü§ù Contributing

This is the frontend UI component. API integration should be handled by a separate backend service.
